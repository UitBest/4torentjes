## Technologies Used

This project is built using Laravel Livewire and TailwindCSS. Laravel Livewire provides a dynamic frontend without leaving the comfort of Laravel, while TailwindCSS offers a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

### Key Technologies:
- **Laravel Livewire:** For a seamless integration between the backend and frontend.
- **TailwindCSS:** For styling and responsive design.

_Note: This project does not use any external APIs as there is no CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interaction._
